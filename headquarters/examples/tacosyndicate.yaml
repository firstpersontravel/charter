            OK you’re all set to head out - turn right leaving Big Rock from the
            front, and right onto Gough, and head north 2 blocks to Oak St.
            Directions here: {{Inductee.link}}. (Make sure to allow location
            access!)  When you find the guide marker, there will be a 4-digit
            number on it. They tend to be near light posts or bike racks. Send
            the code my way!

            Like I said on the phone, Russell is moving up in our ranks today,
            and I’m pretty sure that package is his ring -- don't forget to
            bring it! It’s a long-standing tradition that newly promoted
            Syndicate capos are notified by the arrival of a Syndicate ring.
            Sure, texting would be easier, but ritual is important around here.

                    on a telephone pole right outside the front entrance of

            Welcome to the family, soldado.


            We will call upon you in the future. We may have an opportunity, or
            perhaps a request. The Syndicate has much to offer. However our next
            engagement goes, I'll just remind you this once: we expect your
            loyalty, reliability, and discretion.


            Until next time,
