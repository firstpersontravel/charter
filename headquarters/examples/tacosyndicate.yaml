            OK you’re all set to head out - turn right leaving Big Rock from the

            Like I said on the phone, Russell is moving up in our ranks today,
            and I’m pretty sure that package is his ring -- don't forget to
            bring it! It’s a long-standing tradition that newly promoted
            Syndicate capos are notified by the arrival of a Syndicate ring.
            Sure, texting would be easier, but ritual is important around here.

            I looked up that guide marker and it looks like you're headed to RT
            Rotisserie as your next stop; our friends own the place. Head east

                    to confirm you've made the drop. Remember to lock it back

            This particular door is around 37 Lily St. Make a 180 back on
            Hickory to Franklin, then turn left, then right on Lily. It'll be on
            your left. Text me the guide marker when you get there.

            We will call upon you in the future. We may have an opportunity, or
            perhaps a request. The Syndicate has much to offer. However our next
            engagement goes, I'll just remind you this once: we expect your
            loyalty, reliability, and discretion.
